			<h2>Biography</h2>
			<p>My name is Adam Gincel, and I'm a 3/4 CS undergrad at Stevens Institute of Technology. I'm President of the Game Development Club, Treasurer of the Computer and Console Gaming Society, and a member of the Stevens Concert Band and Concert Choir. In my spare time I make games and write music, but also make sure I fit in academics and even fun when I can. I hail from central New Jersey, and didn't go to Rutgers like most of my high school class.</p>

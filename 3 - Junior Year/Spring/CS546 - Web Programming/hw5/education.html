			<h2>Stevens Institute of Technology</h2>
			<h3>B.S. in Computer Science with a Minor in Quantitative Finance</h3>
			<p>Favorite class: Systems Programming (CS392)</p>
			<p>Favorite memory: My first semester at the Stevens Game Development Club stands out to me as it really set the course for my entire career at Stevens. The people I met and the things I learned as a member, and now the President, of SGDC shaped me into the person I am today, and I'm very greatful for them.</p>

			<h2>Monroe Township High School</h2>
			<h3>High School Certificate</h3>
			<p>Favorite class: Honors Advanced Web Design</p>
			<p>Favorite memory: I was the Drum Major of our school's Marching Band in Fall 2013 -- at the end of that season we went out to Allentown PA and won Nationals, beating out 33 other marching bands in our division. I would classify that moment as the peak of my high school career, where all of the work and effort I had put into something truly paid off.</p>

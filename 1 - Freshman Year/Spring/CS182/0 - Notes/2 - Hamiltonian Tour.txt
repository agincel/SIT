2-Hamiltonian Tour

Hamiltonian Circuit or Tour

--

k-clique

--
NP-Complete

Complexity Theory: lets us compare algorithms to see which will be better for large input.

Computability Theory: is there a solution in computing that exists. Does an algorithm exist?

1900: David Hilbert, had 23 mathematical problems for the coming century to solve.

Devise an algorithm that determines whether any diophantine equation with integer coefficients has an integral solution.

Turing Machines: Alan Turing, 1936
Lambda-Calculus: (Church-Kleene 1932-1941)
Recursive Functions (Godel 1934)
Post Systems (Post 1943)
Markov Systems (Markov 1960)

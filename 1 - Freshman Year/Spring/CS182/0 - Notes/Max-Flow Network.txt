Max-Flow Network

Use Flow on edges such that flow <= weight of edge

Maximize Flow from src to dst

Sum of inflow == sum of outflow.

Residual Network: any arrow opposite to the original implies leftover of that much.

Ford-Fulkerson

Create residual network. (reverse of everything you have)

findAugmentingPath() //fap algorithm



unsigned int findAugmentingPath(curr, dst, flow)
{
	mark curr as visited
	if(curr == dst)
		return flow;

	for(v neighbors of curr)
		if(V ! visited)
		{
			min = minimum(flow, weight(curr, v));
			if((min = findAP(v, dst, min)) > 0)
				{
					ResNet[curr][v] -= min;
					ResNet[v][curr] += min; //augment the network


					return min;
				}
		}

}

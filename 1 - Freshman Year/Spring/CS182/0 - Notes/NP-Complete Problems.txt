NP-Complete Problems

P is contained in NP.

NP complete is a subset of Turing Machines in NP that can be converted into each other in polynomial time. 

Partial solution: steps on the way leading to a candidate solution. If a partial solution will never lead to a candidate solution, you get rid of a whole section of your solutions via pruning. 

Backtracking:
4_Queen problem.

State-Space tree: what tree holds all states that could lead to an answer.

Board with 0-4 queens
if < 4 queens "partial state"
if 4 queens "candidate state"

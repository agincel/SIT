	<p>Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. I sense much fear in you.</p>

	<p>If that's true, if you don't know who I am, then maybe your best course...would be to tread lightly.</p>

	<p>Well, what can I tell you? Life in the wide world goes on much past it has this past Age, full of its own comings and goings, scarcely aware of the existence of Hobbits, for which I am very thankful.</p>

	<p>He's not pining! He's passed on! This parrot is no more! He has ceased to be! 'E's expired and gone to meet his maker! He's a stiff! Bereft of life, he rests in peace! If you hadn't nailed him to the perch he'd be pushing up the daisies! His metaolic processes are now history! He's off the twig! He's kicked the bucket, he's shuffled off his mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleeding choir invisible!! THIS IS AN EX-PARROT!!</p>

	<p>You say you're fearsome pirates, scheming, thieving, bad bushwackers. From what I've seen, I'll tell you, you're not pirates, you're just slackers!</p>

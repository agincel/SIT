Adam Gincel - Assignment 3: Guitar Hero
I pledge my honor I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.

The program requires cos126.StdDraw and cos126.StdAudio

Song files are all given in the songs/ folder, which the program checks by default. 

Song files are given in a format where each line represents a single beat of the song, and multiple notes can be on each line. They will be played simultaneously if on the same line.

I have provided some song files for you to test: try running the program with:
-play_from_file newleaf.txt
-play_from_file melee.txt
-play_from_file twinkle.txt
or
-play_from_file furelise.txt

# Q: My xterm scrollbar does not work with screen.
# A (short): Uncomment the following line:
termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@

# A (long): 
# The problem is that xterm will not allow scrolling if the
# alternate text buffer is selected. The standard definitions of the
# termcap initialize capabilities ti and te switch to and from the
# alternate text buffer. You can tell screen not to use these 
# initialisations by adding the line:
#
#   termcapinfo xterm ti@:te@
#
# to your ~/.screenrc file.

# Show the list of tabs on the bottom line, with the current tab highlighted
caption always '%-Lw%{.kG} %n%f %t %{-}%+Lw' 

# Don't run /bin/sh, run /usr/bin/bash
shell /usr/bin/bash

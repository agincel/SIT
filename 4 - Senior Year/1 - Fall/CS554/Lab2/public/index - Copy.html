                <p> Mob enlists himself under the wing of Arataka Reigen, a con artist claiming to be a psychic, who exploits Mob's powers for pocket change. 
                    Now, exorcising evil spirits on command has become a part of Mob's daily, monotonous life. 
                    However, the psychic energy he exerts is barely the tip of the iceberg; if his vast potential and unrestrained emotions run berserk, 
                    a cataclysmic event that would render him completely unrecognizable will be triggered.</p>

In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored.</p>

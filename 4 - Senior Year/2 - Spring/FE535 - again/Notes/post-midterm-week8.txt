df(0, 2y) = (1 + (0.5 / 100) * (1/2) * (0.9987 + 0.9967 + 0.9947)) / (1 - (0.5 / 100) * (1/2)) = 0.99

Credit Default Swap Spread
Funded vs Unfunded

If a CDS defaults you have to pay Notional * (1 - RecoveryRate)%

Can be settled Physically or via Cash.

Physical Settlement
	- you buy protection and own the bond
	- physical protection: you give bond to seller, get 100%
		- why equal to 1-R?
		- Bond is worth R when you give it to seller, buys it for 1 - R.

this is book chapter 6

			-> C (premium)
			<- Default

PV of Premium = sum 1 to N(C*deltai*dfi*SurvivalProbabilityAtT)

C*sum(deltaidfiSTi)
that whole sum is called PV01. idgi

PV of default is...?
You get 1 - R. 
Q(t) = 1 - S(t), Q(t) is basically death likelihood
PV = (1 - R) * integral from 0 to maturity of (dQ(t)e^(-rt))
				this integral will turn into a sum of discount factors
dQ(t) = -dS(t)

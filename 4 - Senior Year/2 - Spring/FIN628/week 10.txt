Final exam:
Problem 1: Binomial Trees, 2 or 3 step, price an option
Problem 2: Black-Schoules, price an option. Will be given base formula, not any modifications. Expected to solve for Delta. Other parameter formulas given
Problem 3: Using the greeks to do stuff?

=============================

delta_p = 0
gamma_p = -3000
delta_call = 0.62
gamma_call = 1.5

olddelta_p + w_a*

== again:

I have a portfolio that starts as delta neutral. This means it probably has some owned shares and some options. The gamma is nonzero, -3000. This means I'm not fully hedged. To be fully hedged I have two choices. Choice 1: dynamically delta hedge, every time delta changes I change. Or, I can try to hedge for gamma. gamma of the underlying is actually zero, so no amount of calls or puts will change it. A linearly independent instrument can change it.

Gamma: how much does this delta change when the stock changes, basically delta of delta over stock price change.

Theta: rate of change of the value of our portfolio with respect to time.

=====

We have a delta-neutral portfolio

delta_p = 0
gamma_p = -5000
vega_p = -8000

delta_1 = 0.6
gamma_1 = 0.5
vega_1 = 2

delta_2 = 0.5
gamma_2 = 0.8
vega_2 = 1.2

to fix both gamma and vega, we need two linearly independent assets

gamma_new = -5000 + w_1*0.5 + w_2*0.8 = 0
vega_new = -8000 + w_1*2 + w_2*1.2 = 0

//solve with a l g e b r a
after math you get
w_1 = 400
w_2 = 6000
Makes it delta, gamma, and vega neutral (after you fix delta with underlying)
